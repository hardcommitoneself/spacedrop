# Namespace
## Introduction
[SpaceDrop](http://spacedropcms.org/) isolates its libraries to avoid
polluting your own implementations. The structure is mainly inspired from
Drupal's one so that it eases developers adherence to understand the project
structure.

## Usage
```sh
meteor add spacedrop:namespaces
```
