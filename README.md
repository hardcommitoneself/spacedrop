## API examples

> Below APIs are functional, more APIs are coming soon!

### Menu API

#### Create route to view content of type node.

```
SD.Menu.route({
  path: 'node/:nid',
  component: SD.Views.Node,
  subscriptions: {
    'node.node': ['nid']
  }
})
```

### Permission API

#### Create permission to access published content.

```
SD.Permission.permission({
  name: 'access content',
  title: 'View published content'
});
```

#### Create a role with limited permissions.

```
SD.Permission.role({
  name: 'guest',
  permissions: {
    'access content': 1
  }
});
```

### Entity API

#### Create an entity of type "node".

```
let Node = class extends SD.Structure.Entity {
  constructor({ name, schema = {}, indexes = {} }) {
    super({
      type: 'node',
      bundle: name,
      schema: _.extend({
        nid: {
          type: Number,
          optional: true,
          autoValue: () => {
            return this.collection.find().count() + 1;
          }
        },
        bundle: {
          type: String,
          optional: true,
          autoValue: function() {
            return name;
          }
        },
        title: {
          type: String
        }
      }, schema)
    });

    // Ensure index for entity type node.
    Node._ensureIndex('nid', {unique: 1});
  }
}

// Export Node to packages and application.
SD.Structure.Node = Node;
```

### Node API

#### Create a content type (bundle) with the name "page".

```
let Page = new SD.Structure.Node({
  name: 'page',
  schema: {
    body: {
      type: String
    }
  }
});
```

#### List all pages (nodes of content type "page").

```
let nodes = Page.find();
```

#### List all nodes regardless of content type (bundle).

```
let nodes = SD.Structure.Node.find();
```
